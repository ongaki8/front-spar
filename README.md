# Assembly Design of Aircraft PART 9911833 Spar
The project aimed to analyze a technical 2D drawing of an aircraft wing front spar and use CATIA to develop a 3D model of both the assembly jig and the front spar, while also providing an overview of the assembly process for the 9911833 spar.

The development of user-friendly software has enhanced aircraft design by automating design calculations, modeling, and visualization. The aircraft wing is subjected to various loads such as lift, fuel, engine, landing gear, inertial, structural, non-structural, and aerodynamic loads. The main load-bearing members of the wing are known as spars, which include vertical and horizontal stabilizer spars. These spars are the primary structural members that run parallel to the lateral axis of the aircraft from the fuselage to the wing tip, and are typically attached to the fuselage by wing fittings, plain beams, or a truss.
